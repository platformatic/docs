            <h1>Why Platformatic?</h1>
            <p>
              Platformatic enables developers to efficiently develop and run APIs at scale.
              Historically, API developers have had to repetitively build infrastructure to satisfy
              foundational requirements, like authentication, authorization, caching, and connection
              to databases, and have had to manage microservices with technologies such as service mesh
              or centralized registries. This work is time consuming, undifferentiated, and painstakingly
              complex. With growing demands of SaaS applications, the amount of API permutations has grown 
              exponentially and has become a development bottleneck. This has led large organizations to 
              create dedicated platform API engineering teams to help teams deliver on business demands.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our goal is to make API development simple: we aim is to remove all friction from the day-to-day
              of backend developers. Platformatic is a series of Open Source tools to build APIs.

            <h1>Our first tool: Platformatic DB</h1>
            <p>
              The first friction we are solving is the tiresome mapping of databases table to APIs that
              burden any developer. Platformatic DB is a tool that will allow you to create both OpenAPI
              and GraphQL schemas from your database, without having to write a single line of code.
              The key difference with other tools is that Platformatic DB will allow you to customize
              it via <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://www.fastify.io">Fastify</a> plugins.
            </p>
